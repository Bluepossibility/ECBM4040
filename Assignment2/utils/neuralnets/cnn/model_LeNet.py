    LeNet is an early and famous CNN architecture for image classfication task.
    It is proposed by Yann LeCun. Here we use its architecture as the startpoint
    for your CNN practice. Its architecture is as follow.

    input >> Conv2DLayer >> Conv2DLayer >> flatten >>
    DenseLayer >> AffineLayer >> softmax loss >> output

    Or

    input >> [conv2d-avgpooling] >> [conv2d-avgpooling] >> flatten >>
