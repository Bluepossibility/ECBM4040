Another important consideration is the selection of good initialization values for ANN parameters, which may help the model to not overfit. This task addresses some of the regularization methods, such as **Dropout** and **Batch Normalization**. You will implement these two methods in NumPy."

It can lead to enhanced performance in neural networks. You will write a data generator which does several data augmentations on your dataset."

You need to keep updating your CNN in iterations to get the best possible result. Kaggle will enable you to observe the progress made by students in the class. You can use any/all of the deep learning modelling techniques (e.g. regularization, optimization) to get the best possible performance. You have to use TensorFlow 2.4 to build your model."
