# Assignment 0 - distributed in Github Repo e4040-2021Fall-assign0
The assignment is distributed as a Jupyter notebook called Assignment 0.ipynb from a Github repository (or as a zip file).  Additional instructions and support material for the assignment can be found in file README.md which comes with the assignment. The assignment uses TensorFlow version 2.4. 

The simplest way to initially see the content of the jupyter notebook file Assignment 0.ipynb is to use Google Colab in the cloud: (i) Use your UNI@columbia.edu account to log into Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb); (ii) Upload Assignment 0.ipynb, explore and run the file. 

TODO Students should execute the Assignment0 as soon as possible in Google colab, before the add/drop date.

TODO For students who are formally registered into this class after the end of the add/drop period, the assignment requires that students (for the second time, afterColab) complete the tasks from this Jupyter Notebook while running it on the Google Cloud (GCP) custom image (not Colab, Colab is only a temporary execution method).

# Detailed instructions how to submit the solution to this assignment/homework, after add/drop, for fully registered students:
1. The assignment will be distributed (for the second time, after add/drop) as a Github classroom assignment - as a special repository accessed through a link
2. Student's copy of the assignment gets created automatically with a special name - students have to rename per instructions below
3. The solution to the assignment has to be submitted inside that repository as a "solved" Jupyter Notebook
4. Three files/screenshots need to be uploaded into the directory "figures" which prove that the assignment has been done in the cloud

## Screenshots for illustrating/documenting that the assignment was done in the Google cloud
In folder "figures", the instructors provide 3 screenshots as an example that shows that the assignment 0 is done in the Google Cloud.<br>
1. a screenshot showing that a VM instance is running under the project **ecbm-UNI**.
2. a screenshot showing that a jupyter notebook is running in the instance under envTF22.
3. a screenshot showing that assignment 0 file, with the IP address on top of the browser.

Students must upload three similar screenshots in the same directory, but with the modified names - add UNI in front of the file names
1. UNI_gcp_work_example_screenshot_1.png
2. UNI_gcp_work_example_screenshot_2.png
3. UNI_gcp_work_example_screenshot_3.png

## (Re)naming of the student repository (TODO students)
INSTRUCTIONS for naming the student's solution repository for assignments with one student:
* Students need to use the following name for the repository with their solutions: e4040-2021Spring-assign0-UNI (the first part "e4040-2021Spring-assign0" will probably be inherited from the assignment, so only UNI needs to be added) 
* Initially, the system may give the repo a name which ends with a student's Github userid. The student should change that name and replace it with the name requested in the point above
* Good Example: e4040-2021Fall-assign0-zz9999;   Bad example: e4040-2021Fall-assign0-e4040-2021Spring-assign0-zz9999.
* This change can be done from the "Settings" tab which is located on the repo page.

INSTRUCTIONS for naming the students' solution repository for assignments with more students, such as the final project. Students need to use a 4-letter groupID): 
* Template: e4040-2021Fall-Project-GroupID-UNI1-UNI2-UNI3. -> Example: e4040-2021Fall-Project-MEME-zz9999-aa9999-aa0000.
